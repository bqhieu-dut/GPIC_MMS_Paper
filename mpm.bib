  abstract = {Abstract The material point method (MPM) has demonstrated itself as a computationally effective particle method for solving solid mechanics problems involving large deformations and/or fragmentation of structures, which are sometimes problematic for finite element methods (FEMs). However, similar to most methods that employ mixed Lagrangian (particle) and Eulerian strategies, analysis of the method is not straightforward. The lack of an analysis framework for MPM, as is found in FEMs, makes it challenging to explain anomalies found in its employment and makes it difficult to propose methodology improvements with predictable outcomes. In this paper we present an analysis of the quadrature errors found in the computation of (material) internal force in MPM and use this analysis to direct proposed improvements. In particular, we demonstrate that lack of regularity in the grid functions used for representing the solution to the equations of motion can hamper spatial convergence of the method. We propose the use of a quadratic B-spline basis for representing solutions on the grid, and we demonstrate computationally and explain theoretically why such a small change can have a significant impact on the reduction in the internal force quadrature error (and corresponding ‘grid crossing error’) often experienced when using MPM.

  abstract = {Abstract The material point method (MPM) is a computationally effective particle method with mathematical roots in both particle-in-cell and finite element-type methods. The method has proven to be extremely useful in solving solid mechanics problems involving large deformations and/or fragmentation of structures, problem domains that are sometimes problematic for finite element-type methods. Recently, the MPM community has focused significant attention on understanding the basic mathematical error properties of the method. Complementary to this thrust, in this paper we show how spatial and temporal errors are typically coupled within the MPM framework. In an attempt to overcome the challenge to analysis that this coupling poses, we take advantage of MPM's connection to finite element methods by developing a ‘moving-mesh’ variant of MPM that allows us to use finite element-type error analysis to demonstrate and understand the spatial and temporal error behaviors of MPM. We then provide an analysis and demonstration of various spatial and temporal errors in MPM and in simplified MPM-type simulations. Our analysis allows us to anticipate the global error behavior in MPM-type methods and allows us to estimate the time-step where spatial and temporal errors are balanced. Larger time-steps result in solutions dominated by temporal errors and show second-order temporal error convergence. Smaller time-steps result in solutions dominated by spatial errors, and hence temporal refinement produces no appreciative change in the solution. Based upon our understanding of MPM from both analysis and numerical experimentation, we are able to provide to MPM practitioners a collection of guidelines to be used in the selection of simulation parameters that respect the interplay between spatial (grid) resolution, number of particles and time-step.
